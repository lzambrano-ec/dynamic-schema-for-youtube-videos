## How does it work?
***
This wordpress plugin automatically detects any youtube video you embed on your website and creates a VideoObject Schema. Unlike many other plugins in which you have to enter each field required by schema.org, with this plugin you will only have to enter the YouTube API from the plugin settings so that it delivers all the necessary information without you having to return to do anything else.
